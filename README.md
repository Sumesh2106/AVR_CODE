This code converts the data received through serial communication into hexadecimal. When data is sent or received via serial communication, it is sent in hexadecimal form. If we enter any data through the keyboard into the microcontroller, it is automatically converted into ASCII and stored in an unsigned integer variable. Therefore, the value can be accessed in decimal. Now, this stored value is converted into hexadecimal.
This code is created for AVR controller,tested in Atmega 16 .language used was embedded c.
