AVR_CODE_DECIMAl_TO_HEX_CONVERTION_C
This code is to convert the receiving data into hexa
in serial communication the data is received or send in the from hexdecimal
if we send any type of data through keybord to the microcontroller it display in ASCII, converts automatically in ASCII 
we store the ascii in a variable(unsigned int)
so the value can access in decimal
now we convert the stored
